# Simple-Memory-Game
My recreation of the iconic Simon Says memory game
If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
  I got help from two software engineer friends Luke Cranfill and Riley Marfin

What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it?
  My biggest challenge with this project was not knowing any bit of javascript. I have only had an entry level introduction of computer science and the class was in Java so i truly knew nothing about javascript. A technical issue I encountered was that I couldn't figure out how to get the next sequence that is played to not blend in with the playback of the user's previous guess. I also found it difficult to find the right balance of tone length. Sometimes it felt like it was too long of a sound but when i shortened it, it still felt off in some way.

if you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific

If I had more time, I would have loved to figure out how I could've made the buttons the shape of the real Simon says game. I would have also wanted to be able to implement the real sound to it and not the generic tones we were given. An additional feature that could have made this a better game would have been to be able to randomize the pattern instead of a preset pattern.
